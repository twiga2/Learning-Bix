Bioinformatics Tutorials
------------------------

These assignments are mainly based on the practical sessions at the Eastern Africa Network for Bioinformatics Training [(EANBiT)](https://www.fic.nih.gov/Grants/Search/Pages/bioinformatics-TW010677.aspx) from 11th June to 13th July, 2018.  

Assignment 1: Linux Fundamentals
---------------------------------
Using [nrf1_seq.fa](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ul7d3qlfr066hy/nrf1_seq.fa?dl=0), answer the following questions:

1. How many *organisms* are represented in the sequence file provided? Which command did you use?

2. How many of these sequences are *mRNA*?

3. How many *nucleotides* are in the 18th sequence? Which commands did you use.

4. Create a file (*seq_ids.txt*) containing all the sequence IDs, are there duplicates?

The indicative solutions are indicated on Assignment1.pdf file in this repo. The bash script *assign1* is a solution for question 1.
